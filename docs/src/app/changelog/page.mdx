# Changelog

## V0.2.0 (FEBRUARY 2025)

Non-tabular data support, multi-range reads, and compact output.

- Added `--no-header` flag to `probe`, `read`, `search`, and `export` for non-tabular sheets (P&L reports, dashboards). Treats row 1 as data and uses column letters (A, B, C) as headers
- Added `--compact/--no-compact` mode to `read` and `export` (default: on). Drops fully-null columns to reduce token waste
- Added `--all-sheets` flag to `read` for reading the same range(s) from every sheet
- Added multi-range read support — comma-separated ranges like `"Sheet1!A1:C10,E1:G10"`
- Added `--range` / `-r` option flag to `screenshot` (alternative to positional RANGE arg)
- Added `--vba` and `--format` / `-f` flags to `inspect`
- Changed auto-detection priority — Aspose is now checked first for `screenshot` and `recalc` (was Excel first)
- Added shell-escaped cell reference normalisation for zsh compatibility (`\!` in ranges)
- Fixed xlwings screenshot transparency — PNGs are now opaque (flattened onto white background)
- Enhanced LibreOffice multi-page PDF rendering and print area optimisation
- Improved formula detection in compact mode
- Added `aspose-cells-python` as a direct dependency

## V0.1.1 (FEBRUARY 2025)

CLI polish release.
